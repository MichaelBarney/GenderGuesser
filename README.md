# GenderGuesser
An algorithm that makes an NLP statistical guess to answer if a name is male or female.

This project was created as part of my certification in Microsfoft's Natural Language Processing (NLP) course, being heavily inspired by its presented content.

The created Jupyter Notebook is greatly documented, and can be found [here](https://github.com/MichaelBarney/GenderGuesser/blob/master/classicGender.ipynb "here").
